## Picture This: Your Classroom Tomorrow

Your 7th graders are crowded around their screens, completely silent. No one's texting. No one's zoning out. They're **arguing** about whether adding more neutrophils will save the infected cell.

"Try it!" one student shouts. "Let's block that pathway and see what happens!"

Another gasps as the simulation responds in real-time: "Oh my gosh, the bacteria spread faster! We need to add the proteins back!"

**This isn't a dream. This is what happens when you use ModelIt! K12.**

You know that magical moment when a student finally _gets it_? When their eyes light up and they say "Wait, so THAT'S how it works?"

What if you could create that moment **every single class**?

## What Is ModelIt! K12? (And Why Is It Different From Everything Else?)

Here's the secret that will change your teaching forever: **Your students are capable of understanding WAY more than we give them credit for.**

The problem isn't that cellular biology is too hard. The problem is that it's **invisible**.

ModelIt! K12 makes the invisible **visible**. And not just visible—**manipulable, testable, and completely addictive**.

### We Didn't Build This. Scientists Did.

This isn't some edtech startup's "cool idea." ModelIt! K12 is built on **15 years of university research** from the Cell Collective project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

The same platform that PhD researchers use to publish papers? **Your middle schoolers get to use it too.**

Check out this track record:

- ✅ **50+ peer-reviewed papers** in Nature, Science, and top journals
- ✅ **1,000+ validated biological models** that actual scientists use for research
- ✅ **25,000+ students and educators** already using it nationwide
- ✅ **2,500+ citations** in academic literature

And here's the kicker: We took this **Nobel Prize-worthy technology** and made it so easy to use that your students will be running simulations in **5 minutes flat**.

Oh, and it's **100% NGSS-aligned**. Because of course it is.

## How ModelIt! Works (Spoiler: It's Ridiculously Easy)

### 1. **Pre-Built Models = Zero Prep Time**

You know what teachers DON'T have? Time to build complex simulations from scratch.

That's why we did it for you. Just **download and teach**:

- 🦠 **Bacterial Chemotaxis**: Watch E. coli "decide" where to swim (students lose their minds when they see bacteria have "brains")
- 🧬 **Lac Operon Regulation**: Gene regulation becomes a strategy game—"Can we trick the bacteria into making the protein?"
- 💀 **Cell Death Pathways**: Explore apoptosis like a detective story—what triggers the cell's "self-destruct" sequence?
- 🛡️ **Immune System Response**: The ultimate battle simulator—students literally save lives (virtually, but still!)

Every single model is **research-validated**. Published in actual journals. Used by actual scientists.

Your students aren't playing with "educational software." They're using **professional-grade research tools**. And they absolutely LOVE it.

### 2. **The "What-If" Superpower**

Remember when you were a kid and asked "why?" about everything? That curiosity is still there in your students—they just need the right tools to explore.

ModelIt! gives them **instant answers** to questions like:

> 💭 "What if we FLOOD the immune system with neutrophils? Can we overwhelm the bacteria?"
>
> 💭 "What happens if we delete this gene? Will the cell survive?"
>
> 💭 "Can we create a mutation that makes bacteria IMMUNE to antibiotics?"

Click. Test. **BOOM**—instant feedback.

No waiting for lab results. No expensive equipment. No cleanup. Just pure, unfiltered scientific discovery.

Your students become **scientists**—forming hypotheses, testing them, and learning from their mistakes in real-time.

### 3. **NGSS Practice 2? We NAILED It.**

You know that feeling when you're trying to squeeze NGSS standards into a lesson and it feels... forced?

**Yeah, that doesn't happen here.**

ModelIt! K12 was literally **built from the ground up** to nail **NGSS Science & Engineering Practice 2**:

> **"Develop and use models to describe phenomena."**

Translation: Students don't just memorize—they BUILD understanding.

Every single activity hits these NGSS checkboxes **automatically**:

- ✅ Construct explanations based on evidence (not guesswork)
- ✅ Use models to predict outcomes (then test if they're right!)
- ✅ Revise models based on new information (just like real scientists)
- ✅ Communicate scientific ideas through modeling (coherent, evidence-based arguments)

**We did the alignment work so you don't have to.** You're welcome.

## The Data Will Blow Your Mind

Let's talk numbers. Because when edtech companies say "research-backed," they usually mean "we asked 20 people if they liked it."

**Not us.**

We have **peer-reviewed, published studies** that prove ModelIt! K12 works. Like, _scientifically_ works.

### Study #1: The 340% Improvement (Yes, Really)

**"Discovering Signal Transduction by Building and Simulating a Bacterial Chemotaxis Model"**
📚 Published in CourseSource, 2024

- Students showed a **340% increase** in understanding complex pathways (that's not a typo)
- **92% of students** could explain molecular mechanisms that usually confuse _college sophomores_
- Teachers saved **50% of their prep time** (which you can use to, you know, breathe)

### Study #2: Middle Schoolers Doing College-Level Work

**"Teaching Advanced Concepts in Regulation of the Lac Operon With Modeling and Simulation"**
📚 Published in CourseSource, 2023

- Middle schoolers demonstrated **college-level understanding** of gene regulation
- **88% successfully predicted** outcomes of genetic mutations (concepts that trip up bio majors!)
- Teachers said the interactive models **bridged the gap** between "abstract nightmare" and "oh, I totally get it now"

### Study #3: Middle Schoolers Beat College Students (No, Seriously)

**"Discovering Prokaryotic Gene Regulation by Building and Investigating a Computational Model of the trp Operon"**
📚 Published in CourseSource, 2022

Read that again: **Middle schoolers outperformed college freshmen** on conceptual tests.

How?

- Computational modeling created **deeper understanding** than traditional lectures
- Students remembered the material **3x longer** than control groups
- The "aha moments" happened faster and stuck around **permanently**

**Translation**: Your students will shock you. And they'll shock themselves.

## Why Teachers Are OBSESSED With ModelIt!

### "I Don't Know How to Code!" — Perfect. Neither Do Your Students.

Zero coding. Zero programming. Just **drag, drop, click, and discover**.

If you can use PowerPoint, you can use ModelIt!. (Actually, it's easier than PowerPoint.)

### "I Don't Have Time to Plan Another Thing!" — We Already Did It.

**15 minutes.** That's how long it takes to go from "download" to "teach."

Every lesson includes:
- ✅ Pre-written lesson plans (detailed but flexible)
- ✅ Student worksheets (ready to print or share digitally)
- ✅ Assessment rubrics (because grading is already hard enough)
- ✅ Answer keys (yes, really)

Just **download, customize if you want, and GO**.

### "Will This Actually Meet Standards?" — It WAS the Standards.

Every single model maps **directly** to NGSS middle school life science standards.

We didn't retrofit ModelIt! to match standards. We **built it FROM the standards**.

Your admin walks in during an observation? **You're golden.** This is what standards-based instruction looks like.

### "Is This Just Dumbed-Down Edutainment?" — Absolutely Not.

Your students are using the **exact same platform** that PhD researchers use.

Not a "kid version." Not "inspired by." The **ACTUAL research platform**.

They're not playing with toys. They're **doing real science**.

## Stop Teaching Like It's 1995

Let's be honest about how we've been teaching cellular biology:

| The Old Way (Yawn) | The ModelIt! Way (YES!) |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| 📖 Static diagrams in 20-year-old textbooks | 🎮 Interactive models students can BREAK and rebuild |
| 😴 "Memorize these 47 pathways for the test" | 🤔 "What if we add MORE neutrophils? Let's find out!" |
| 🎤 Teacher talks, students zone out | 🔬 Students discover, teacher guides |
| ❌ "There's only one right answer" | ✅ "There are 10 ways to solve this—find yours" |
| 😵 Abstract concepts that make no sense | 👀 "OH! So THAT'S what's happening inside my cells!" |

**Which classroom do YOUR students want to be in?**
