If you’ve ever stared at NGSS codes and wondered, “What does this look like on Tuesday at 10:15 a.m. with 28 seventh graders?”—this post is for you. We’ll make MS-LS1-2 and MS-LS1-3 concrete, show how ModelIt! K12 and Cell Collective models streamline the science and engineering practices, and give you a classroom-ready rubric and weeklong plan you can copy tomorrow.

What MS-LS1-2 and MS-LS1-3 actually ask students to do

- MS-LS1-2: Develop and use a model to describe the function of a cell as a whole and how the parts of cells contribute to the cell’s function.
- MS-LS1-3: Use argument supported by evidence for how the body is a system of interacting subsystems composed of groups of cells.

In other words:
- Students build and revise models that show how organelles work together so a cell functions.
- Students argue, with evidence, that tissues and organs interact to keep an organism alive and stable.

How ModelIt! K12 supports the three dimensions for each standard

MS-LS1-2
- Science and Engineering Practice: Developing and using models
  - Students build dynamic models in ModelIt! K12 powered by Cell Collective nodes for organelles (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes) and processes (e.g., protein synthesis, ATP production). They run simulations to see how changes propagate through the system.
- Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A Structure and Function
  - Each organelle node includes embedded resources and prompts that focus on structure-function relationships (e.g., folded cristae increase surface area for ATP synthesis).
- Crosscutting Concepts: Structure and Function; Systems and System Models
  - Visual networks help students grasp systems boundaries, components, and interactions. Structure-function links are explicit in node annotations and model tests.

MS-LS1-3
- Science and Engineering Practice: Engaging in argument from evidence
  - ModelIt! K12’s built-in “Evidence Cards” let students log observations from their simulations, readings, and labs, then assemble CER (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning) arguments.
- Disciplinary Core Idea: LS1.A and LS1.D (systems of cells form tissues and organs; interactions maintain life)
  - Ready-to-run subsystems models (e.g., Digestive–Circulatory–Respiratory nutrient and gas exchange) show how groups of cells support organ and system functions.
- Crosscutting Concepts: Systems and System Models; Cause and Effect; Stability and Change
  - Students test how disruptions (e.g., narrowed blood vessel, reduced alveolar surface area) alter system performance and homeostasis.

Three classroom-tested ModelIt! K12 + Cell Collective model sequences

Sequence A: The Cell as a Factory (MS-LS1-2)
- Driving question
  - How do the parts of a cell work together to build and ship a protein?
- ModelIt! K12 model
  - “Eukaryotic Cell: Protein Journey” (Cell Collective)
- Lesson flow
  1) Elicit prior ideas with a quick draw: students sketch “protein-making” and label parts.
  2) Introduce the model nodes: DNA (nucleus), mRNA, ribosome, rough ER, Golgi, vesicle, cell membrane.
  3) Students simulate the baseline run: Does the cell export a functional protein?
  4) Structured perturbations:
     - Turn down “Ribosome Activity” to see effects on protein output.
     - Block “Golgi Packaging” and track downstream impacts.
     - Increase “Mitochondria ATP Production” and observe whether it rescues output.
  5) Students revise sketches to align with evidence from the simulation.
  6) Exit ticket: Describe how at least three organelles interact to support a cell function.
- Why it works
  - Students move beyond “organelle vocab bingo” to systems thinking, connecting energy flow to information flow and matter transport.

Sequence B: Gas Exchange and Nutrient Delivery (MS-LS1-3)
- Driving question
  - How do body subsystems cooperate to deliver oxygen and glucose to muscle cells during a sprint?
- ModelIt! K12 model
  - “Digestive–Circulatory–Respiratory Interactions” (Cell Collective)
- Lesson flow
  1) Anchor with a scenario: A student athlete experiences side stitches and fatigue.
  2) Identify subsystems: Respiratory (alveoli), Circulatory (heart, vessels), Digestive (small intestine), Muscular system (tissue demand).
  3) Baseline simulation: Normal O2 and glucose levels, normal cardiac output.
  4) Perturbations:
     - Reduce alveolar surface area (simulating mild asthma).
     - Narrow systemic arterioles (simulating dehydration).
     - Decrease small intestine absorption rate (low nutrient intake).
  5) Evidence gathering: Students capture quantitative outputs (O2 delivery rate, blood glucose concentration) using screenshots or exported plots.
  6) CER writing: Claim which subsystem limitation most reduces muscle performance and why.
- Why it works
  - Students argue from multi-source evidence (model runs, short readings, quick pulse lab) that systems interactions determine performance.

Sequence C: Homeostasis and Feedback (MS-LS1-2 and MS-LS1-3 bridge)
- Driving question
  - How do feedback mechanisms keep body systems stable?
- ModelIt! K12 model
  - “Thermoregulation Feedback Loop” (Cell Collective)
- Lesson flow
  1) Phenomenon video: Sweating cools you, but shivering warms you—how?
  2) Students run the model with normal hypothalamus set points.
  3) Perturb by changing “Ambient Temperature” and “Sweat Evaporation Rate.”
  4) Record effects on “Core Body Temperature” and “Muscle Thermogenesis.”
  5) Discuss negative vs. positive feedback with evidence from runs.
  6) Students generalize to another system (blood glucose regulation) as an extension.

This 5-day plan blends MS-LS1-2 and MS-LS1-3 while keeping cognitive load manageable.

Day 1: Launch phenomenon and pre-assessment
- Objective
  - Elicit initial ideas about cell structure/function and interacting subsystems.
- Moves
  - Show a short clip of a sprinter finishing a race, then a time-lapse of protein secretion in cells.

- Task options
  - Option 1: Create a cell model variant where protein export fails; annotate three organelle-level causes and propose a fix.
  - Option 2: Write and present a CER argument explaining how two body subsystems interact to restore homeostasis after a disruption, using evidence from at least two model runs.
- Assessment
  - Use the rubric below. Prioritize modeling competence, use of evidence, and crosscutting concepts.

A practical assessment rubric you can paste into your LMS

Use four performance levels across key dimensions. Score holistically or analytically.

Dimension: Developing and Using Models (MS-LS1-2)
- Beginning
  - Model lists parts but lacks meaningful connections or directionality.
  - No simulations or results not interpreted.
- Developing
  - Model shows some connections among organelles; runs at least one simulation.
  - Offers a basic description of results without linking to structure/function.
- Proficient
  - Model correctly connects organelles to explain a function (e.g., protein export), with accurate directionality and interactions.
  - Runs multiple simulations; explains how changes to one organelle affect the whole cell using model outputs.
- Advanced
  - Extends model with justified components or interactions; tests alternative explanations.
  - Compares scenarios quantitatively; uses model to predict novel outcomes.

Dimension: Engaging in Argument from Evidence (MS-LS1-3)
- Beginning
  - Makes a claim with little or no evidence; reasoning missing.
- Developing
  - Includes at least one piece of evidence but vague reasoning connecting evidence to claim.
- Proficient
  - Presents a clear claim about interacting subsystems; supports with multiple, specific pieces of evidence from model outputs and/or lab data; reasoning explicitly links subsystem interactions to outcomes.
- Advanced
  - Weighs competing claims, addresses counterevidence, and justifies why selected evidence is most relevant; considers limitations of the model.

Dimension: Crosscutting Concepts
- Structure and Function (MS-LS1-2)
  - Proficient: Articulates how organelle structure enables function in the modeled process.
- Systems and System Models; Stability and Change (MS-LS1-3)
  - Proficient: Defines system boundaries and components; explains how interactions maintain or disrupt stability.
- Advanced for either
  - Identifies feedback mechanisms and lever rules (e.g., surface area, concentration gradients) that modulate performance.

Dimension: Use of Evidence and Model Revision
- Beginning to Advanced scale
  - Beginning: Rarely records results; does not revise model.
  - Proficient: Records runs systematically; revises model at least once based on evidence with justification.
  - Advanced: Iterative revision cycle with rationale; tracks changes and their impacts on predictions.

Grading tips
- Weight Proficient as your target: 3 points each dimension.
- Provide one glow (strength) and one grow (next step) aligned to the rubric language.
- Keep a short evidence log: screenshot or export a plot plus a two-sentence interpretation.

Real classroom examples from MS science teachers

Ms. Alvarez, 7th grade, urban Title I school
- Challenge
  - Students had memorized organelles but struggled to explain how they work together.
- Move
  - She launched the Eukaryotic Cell model with a “delivery crew” metaphor: DNA as blueprint, ribosome as factory, Golgi as quality control and shipping.
- Evidence in action
  - One group inhibited the Golgi and noticed “protein export” dropped even though ribosomes were active. They revised their claim: “The Golgi isn’t just packaging—it’s essential for functional proteins to exit the cell.”
- Outcome
  - On post-assessment, 82% of students accurately described at least three organelle interactions, up from 34% pre-assessment.

Mr. Chen, 6th grade, rural district with intermittent internet
- Challenge
  - Limited devices and unstable Wi-Fi.
- Move
  - He ran ModelIt! K12 in “teacher simulation” mode projected on the screen. Students used whiteboards to predict outputs before each simulated perturbation.
- Evidence in action
  - The class predicted that narrowing arterioles would decrease O2 delivery more than reduced alveolar surface area; the model showed the opposite under the chosen parameters. Students amended their arguments, citing diffusion limits at the alveoli.
- Outcome
  - Students’ CERs included quantified evidence (e.g., “O2 delivery fell from 0.8 to 0.3 units when alveolar area decreased by 50%”), meeting MS-LS1-3 expectations.

Ms. Patel, 8th grade, inclusive classroom
- Challenge
  - Wide range of reading levels and IEP accommodations.
- Move
  - She leveraged ModelIt! K12’s embedded glossary with audio, chunked tasks, and offered two entry points: a scaffolded prebuilt model and an open-build challenge.
- Evidence in action
  - A student with dyslexia used voice notes to capture reasoning; peers cited his observations in their team CER.
- Outcome
  - Growth across all groups; rubric scores for “Use of Evidence and Model Revision” improved by one level on average over three class periods.

Instructional routines that make the standards stick

- Predict–Run–Explain–Revise cycle
  - Before any simulation, students write a prediction. After running, they explain with numbers and revise their model or claim. This explicitly builds the practice of using models, not just running them.
- Evidence tickets
  - Limit each claim to two high-quality pieces of evidence. Students learn to prioritize and justify.
- Skeptic role
  - One student in each group challenges the claim by requesting specific evidence or pointing out alternative explanations.

Differentiation and access

- English learners
  - Provide dual-language node labels; preteach five core verbs (binds, transports, synthesizes, diffuses, regulates).
  - Use frames: “When we decreased [parameter], [output] changed from [value] to [value], which shows [reasoning].”
- Students with IEPs
  - Offer reduced node sets to limit cognitive load, then layer complexity.
  - Allow multimodal responses (audio, diagrams, sentence starters).
- Advanced learners
  - Invite them to add a justified node (e.g., chaperone proteins) and test its impact, or to explore parameter sensitivity.

Anchoring phenomena you can use tomorrow

- Why can some athletes recover faster between sprints?
- How does a fever affect your energy and appetite?
- What happens to oxygen delivery at high altitude?
Frame each with a driving question, then build toward MS-LS1-2 and MS-LS1-3 with the models described.

Common misconceptions and how the models confront them

- “Each organelle works alone”
  - Strategy: Force a bottleneck (e.g., reduce Golgi function) and show how protein export depends on multiple steps in sequence. Require students to trace the path and identify the rate-limiting step.
- “Respiration equals breathing”
  - Strategy: Use side-by-side nodes for Cellular Respiration and Ventilation. Students observe that oxygen supply affects cellular respiration but is not the same process.
- “Bigger organ = better performance”
  - Strategy: Adjust surface area or flow rate parameters and demonstrate diminishing returns or trade-offs (e.g., viscosity vs. flow).

What to collect as evidence of learning

- Model artifacts
  - Final model graph and annotated diagram explaining at least three interactions among cell structures for a function.
- Simulation logs
  - A run chart with 2–3 perturbations and student interpretations.
- CER write-ups
  - A one-paragraph argument with at least two pieces of model-based evidence.
- Reflection
  - A short metacognitive prompt: “Which change most surprised you? How did it change your model?”

How this aligns with NGSS language and intent

- Models are tools for thinking
  - Students aren’t just labeling organelles—they are using models to predict and explain functions, exactly what the MS-LS1-2 practice calls for.
- Arguments are grounded in evidence
  - Students construct arguments about interacting subsystems with multiple lines of evidence (simulations, mini-labs, texts), matching MS-LS1-3.
- Crosscutting concepts are explicit
  - Systems, structure/function, and stability/change are named and applied in context, supporting transfer across units.

Tech setup tips and time-savers

- Shorten the on-ramp
  - Preload model versions with hidden complexity you can unlock later.
- Keep a parameter “playlist”
  - Prepare 3–4 perturbations and their pedagogical purpose so you can steer discussion quickly.
- Use screenshots strategically
  - Prompt: “Circle the part of the plot that supports your claim. Label it with one sentence.”
- Offline backup
  - Have printed model diagrams with arrows and parameter cards for no-internet days. Students can run “paper simulations” by reasoning through cause-and-effect.

How ModelIt! K12 and Cell Collective work together

- ModelIt! K12 provides the instructional spine
  - Teacher dashboards, prompts, scaffolds, evidence logging, and rubrics aligned to NGSS practices and CCCs.
- Cell Collective provides the computational engine
  - Robust, research-backed dynamic modeling where nodes and interactions behave in biologically plausible ways. Students see emergent behavior, not just static diagrams.

Formative assessment prompts aligned to each standard

For MS-LS1-2
- What happens to protein export if ribosome activity is cut in half? Explain why using organelle interactions.
- Which organelle becomes the rate-limiting step when ATP is low? How do you know?

For MS-LS1-3
- After narrowing arterioles, which variable changes first and why? What does that tell you about subsystem interactions?
- Which change most threatens stability, and how does the system respond?

Administrative talking points for your principal or PLC

- Standards alignment
  - Directly addresses MS-LS1-2 and MS-LS1-3 through modeling and argumentation with clear rubrics and artifacts.
- Assessment-ready
  - Performance tasks yield evidence suitable for common formative assessments and student growth measures.
